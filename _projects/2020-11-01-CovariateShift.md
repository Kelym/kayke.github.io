title: Grasping with Chopsticks&#58; Combating Covariate Shift in Model-free Imitation Learning for Fine Manipulation
excerpt: We focus on imitation learning for fine manipulation and use the chopsticks robot as our test bed. The small, curved, and slippery tips of chopsticks pose a challenge for picking up small objects, making them a suitably complex test case for fine manipulation. Imitation learning traditionally suffers from the covariate shift phenomenon that causes poor generalization. We propose three approaches to reduce covariate shift, none of which requires access to an interactive expert or a model, unlike previous approaches. We demonstrate our methods on a real chopstick-equipped robot that we built, and observe the agent's success rate increase from 37.3% to 80%, which is comparable to the human expert performance of 82.6%.
