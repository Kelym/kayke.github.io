title: Grasping with Chopsticks&#58; Combating Covariate Shift in Model-free Imitation Learning for Fine Manipulation
excerpt: >
 Can you use chopsticks to grasp tiny balls :crystal_ball:? <br>
 The radius of the ball is 7mm or 10mm. So, if you miss the grasping point by 0.5mm, the task would fail. We taught a robot to use chopsticks to autonomously grasp these tiny objects at 80% success rate, comparable to human expert performance of 82.6%. We do so by imitation learning and our baseline, naive behavior cloning, has only 37.3% success rate. We proposed three novels approaches to combat covariate shift.
