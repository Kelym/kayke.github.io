title: :cherry: Cherry Picking with Reinforcement Learning
excerpt: >
We developed a system for fine manipulation (small objects :cherries:) without rigid surface support (floating :ocean:, windy :leaves:, human disturbance) using chopsticks :chopsticks: (simple tool for fine manipulation).
 :mag: The task requires <1mm precision (even in static scene), and we add unmodeled dynamic disturbance <br>
 :robot: Only 30 minutes of real world interactions <br>
 :stop: Too lazy for parameter tuning = off-the-shelf RL algo + default params <br>
 :secret: is to understand the impact of each the design choice <br>
