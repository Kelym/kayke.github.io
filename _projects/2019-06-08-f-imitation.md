title: Imitation Learning as f-Divergence Minimization
excerpt: We propose a general framework for imitation learning (IL), formulating IL as estimating and minimizing f-Divergence. By plugging in different divergences, we are able to recover existing SOTA IL algorithms such as Behavior Cloning, GAIL and Dagger. Our framework shows that these algorithms are all minimizing a lower bound of the trajectory divergence between learner and expert.
