title: Telemanipulation with Chopsticks&#58; Analyzing Human Factors in User Demonstrations
excerpt: Billions of people use chopsticks, a simple yet versatile tool, for fine manipulation of everyday objects. We built a chopsticks-equipped robot and a teleoperation interface to study human manipulation strategies. 25 human subjects used our system to pick up different objects, including a slippery glass ball. Although participants rated teleoperation as the least comfortable and most difficult-to-use method, teleoperation enabled users to achieve the highest success rates on three out of five objects considered.
