title: A Robot with Chopsticks&#58; How do Interfaces and Expertise affect Demonstrations?
excerpt: Chopsticks constitute a simple yet versatile, ubiquitous and effective tool that humans have used for thousands of years to tackle challenging tasks that mostly involved the manipulation of food objects. Inspired by human performance, we focus on manipulation tasks requiring the use of a robot with a chopsticks-equipped end-effector, shown to be useful for surgical interventions, meal assistance, and repetitive pick and place operations. Our goal is to determine which of three data-collection methods – a new teleoperation interface, motion-capture tracked chopsticks, or normal chopstick use – provides the optimal dataset for training robots to use chopsticks; the teleoperation interface we designed maps tracked motions of a human-controlled pair of chopsticks to the motion of the robot’s chopsticks. We studied 25 subjects using the three methods to investigate factors governing human performance in chopsticksbased manipulation tasks for everyday objects. Findings reveal that teleoperation achieved higher success rates on three of ﬁve objects and was the preferred method to pick up hard, slippery and small objects. We conclude that while motion capture provides a better reﬂection of how humans use chopsticks, the teleoperation interface yields the type of high-quality datasets needed to collect on-hardware demonstrations from which the robot can directly learn.
