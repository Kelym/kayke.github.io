title: Grasping with Chopsticks&#58; Fine Grained Manipulation using Inexpensive Hardware by Imitation Learning
excerpt: We hope to leverage human demonstrations to develop autonomous chopsticks-equipped robot manipulator. In this preliminary work, we explored imitation learning methods to learn to pick up small cube and ball-shaped objects from expert's teleoperation demonstrations. We trained a behavior cloning agent, a k-Nearest Neighbors agent, and a blending of the two. We found that blended agent showed some promise.
