Hi, I am Liyiming Ke, or "Kay". I am a grad student at University of Washington. I am passionate about Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning and Vision, and almost everything in Artificial Intelligence or Applied ML.

This blog is inspired by [Seita's Place](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/) and [colah's blog](https://colah.github.io/). It is created on Sep 2017 when I entered grad school. I hope to share my journey in Machine Learning and to splash my random thoughts here. 

You can reach me at ```kayke@cs.washington.edu```
