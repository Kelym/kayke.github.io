Hi, I am Liyiming Ke, or "Kay". I am a grad student at University of Washington. I am passionate about Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning and Vision, and almost everything in Artificial Intelligence or Applied ML.

This blog was created on Sep 2017, when I entered grad school. I got my insprations from [several awesome bloggers]({{site.url}}/links/) writing about Machine Learning. And I hope to share my journey in Machine Learning and to splash my random thoughts here. 

You can reach me at ```kayke@uw.edu```.
