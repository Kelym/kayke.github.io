Hi :wave: I am Liyiming Ke, 柯丽一鸣, or "Kay". I am a grad student at University of Washington working with [Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/) and [Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/). I am passionate about Robots :robot:, Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

## About Me

This blog was created on Sep 2017, when I entered grad school. I got my insprations from [several awesome bloggers]({{site.url}}links/) writing about Machine Learning. And I hope to share my journey in Machine Learning and to splash my random thoughts here.

You can reach me at ```kayke@uw.edu```.
