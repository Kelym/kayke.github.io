Hi, I am Liyiming Ke, 柯丽一鸣, or "Kay". I am a grad student at University of Washington working with [Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/) and [Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/). I am passionate about Imitation Learning, Robotics Manipulation and Reinforcement Learning.

This blog was created on Sep 2017, when I entered grad school. I got my insprations from [several awesome bloggers]({{site.url}}links/) writing about Machine Learning. And I hope to share my journey in Machine Learning and to splash my random thoughts here.

You can reach me at ```kayke@uw.edu```.

## Ongoing Project

<center style="font-family: georgia">The chopstick-based manipulation project
    <br> <span></span> = robot + chopstick + ? ? ?
    <br> <span></span> = picking up challenging items!
</center>
<br>

We started the project in 2019 winter. We have been experimenting with imitation learning, reinforcement learning and control algorithms.
