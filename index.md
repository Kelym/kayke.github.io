Hi, I am Liyiming Ke, or "Kay". I am a grad student at University of Washington working with [Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/). I am passionate about Robotics Manipulation, Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning.

This blog was created on Sep 2017, when I entered grad school. I got my insprations from [several awesome bloggers]({{site.url}}links/) writing about Machine Learning. And I hope to share my journey in Machine Learning and to splash my random thoughts here.

You can reach me at ```kayke@uw.edu```.

## Ongoing Project

As of 2019 winter, I am devoted to the chopstick-based manipulation project.

    <br> <span></span> = robot + chopstick + algorithm
    <br> <span></span> = picking up challenging items!

We started the project in 2019 summer. We have been experimenting with imitation learning, reinforcement learning and control algorithms.

_The demo in display i) tracks the chopsticks held by human, ii) computes inverse-kinematics and iii) use PID control to move the robot. Our 6-DOF robot arm is assembled at the Personal Robotics Lab, based on components from HEBI Robotics. The chopsticks are mounted by 3D printed holders. Tracking of master chopsticks held by human is done via Optitrack._
