Hi :wave: I am Liyiming Ke, 柯丽一鸣, or "Kay". I am a final-year grad student at University of Washington, advised by [Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/). I am passionate about Robotics Learning :robot:. My research focuses on Data-Driven Fine Manipulation. I built [robot system and demo](https://goodcherrybot.github.io/) and developed [theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12888). I was very fortunate to work with [Abhishek Gupta](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/), [Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://robotics.cornell.edu/faculty/tapomayukh-bhattacharjee-bio/), [Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/) and [Sanjiban Choudary](https://sanjibanchoudhury.com/). 


I am on the Faculty Job Market as of 2023 Fall!
